# rreglo-reactjs-ui

This repository is created for implementing typescript, reactJS, redux and next js features, as well as a guide for me in the future.

<pre>
Check for node.js
    - node -v.

Suggested VS Code Extensions.
    - Prettier extension.
        - Code > Preferences > Settings > Search for "format on save".
    - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippet
    - JavaScript and TypeScript nightly
    - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.
</pre>

<pre>
Next.js (Framework = [libs, toolts and conventions])
    - A framework for building fast and search-engine friendly applications
    - Built on top of react.
        - React (Library for building interactive UIs)
    - Has separate libraries.
        ie. Next.js router, no need for 'npm i react-router'.
    - Comes with a Compiler
        - Transform and minify JS code.
    - CLI
        - Build & start app.
    - Has Node.js runtime
        - Execute JS code.

    - Node.js Runtime?
        - Web Browser (Client)
        - Node.js Runtime (Server)
            - Allow devs to do Full-stack development.
                - Front-end - Web Browser
                - Back-end - Node.js Runtime
            - Server-side Rendering
    
    - Static Site Generation
</pre>

<pre>
Client-side Rendering
    - Large bundles
    - Resource intensive
    - No SEO (Search engine box)
    - Less secure

Server-side Rendering
    - Smaller bundles
    - Resource efficient
    - SEO
    - More secure

Server Components cannot:
    - Listen to browser events
    - Access browser APIs
    - Maintain state
    - Use effects

In Next.js all components in the app folder are server components by default.
</pre>

<pre>
Caching
    - Memory
    - File System
    - Network

Rendering
    - Client-side
    - Server-side
        - Static (at build time)
        - Dynamic (at request time)
</pre>

<pre>
Camel Case
    - camelCase

Pascal Case
    - PascalCase

Snake Case
